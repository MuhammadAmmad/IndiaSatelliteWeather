##The Concept:
"A picture is worth a thousand words". A complex weather data can be conveyed with a single image map. By observing the Cloud formations around your City, you can easy predict whether the day is going to be Hot or Rainy/Cloudy.

This application fetches the weather data directly from the Official Indian Government webpage for "satellite Images & Products". URL: http://www.imd.gov.in/

It very well equipped with data caching capabilities and will never download any duplicate data from the server. The downloaded weather maps will stored locally and can accessed in offline.

##Milestones:
1. To provide offline capabilities. - [DONE]
2. To support Infra-red channels of KALPANA-I SECTOR Satellite footages. -[DONE]
3. To support Visible, Color Composite & Water Vapor channels of KALPANA-I SECTOR Satellite footages. -[DONE]
4. To implement Cyclone path movement animation in Android similar to "http://www.imd.gov.in/section/satmet/img/sanew.htm" with offline capabilities. 
5. To provide support to access the weather data through Android Home screen Widgets.
